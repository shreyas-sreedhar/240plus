                Last updated: 22/07/2024 </br>

                1. Introduction
                
                This Privacy Policy describes how the Tweet as Image Chrome extension (referred to as "we," "our," or "the Extension") handles user data. </br>
                
            </br> </br>2. Data Collection and Usage
                
                The Tweet as Image Chrome extension does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information or user data. The Extension operates solely within the user's browser and only interacts with the Twitter/X website.
                
            </br> </br>3. Functionality
                
                The Extension accesses the text entered in the Twitte/X tweet composition box for the sole purpose of converting it into an image. This process occurs entirely within the user's browser. The resulting image is then inserted back into the Twitter/X interface for posting.
                
            </br> </br>4. Data Storage
                
                No user data is stored by the Extension, either locally or on remote servers.
                
            </br> </br>5. Permissions
                
                The Extension requires permission to interact with the Twitter/X website to function properly. It does not access or interact with any other websites or services.
                
            </br> </br>6. Third-Party Services
                
                The Extension does not utilize any third-party services or APIs.
                
            </br> </br>7. Updates to This Policy
                
                We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Users will be notified of any changes through the Chrome Web Store or within the Extension itself.
                
            </br> </br>8. Contact Information
                
                If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at two40plus@gmail.com.
